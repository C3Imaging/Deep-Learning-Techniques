# Off-axis Iris Segmentation
You are in the master branch. 
The following links will lead you to different projects repository:

This is the Matlab code implemenation of the augmentation techniques described in the paper " Deep Neural Network and Data Augmentation Methodology for off-axis iris segmentation in wearable headsets " , https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00389 

The  objective  of  the augmentation  techniques  is  to  simulate  the representation of iris images as captured by a user-facing camera on an AR/VR device. This representation  includes  off-axis  iris  images  mainly  of  elliptical  shape  and  not  centred  in  the image.
