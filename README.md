# Off-axis Iris Segmentation

The executable of the trained network and the Matlab code implemenation of the augmentation techniques described in the paper " Deep Neural Network and Data Augmentation Methodology for off-axis iris segmentation in wearable headsets " , [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00389) 

The executable of the trained as descibed in the paper with instructions on how to use it can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c6e14hqp66d8mvn/AABok629AgKkQc9oV290yEqza?dl=0).

The  objective  of  the augmentation  techniques  is  to  simulate  the representation of iris images as captured by a user-facing camera on an AR/VR device. This representation  includes  off-axis  iris  images  mainly  of  elliptical  shape  and  not  centred  in  the image.
